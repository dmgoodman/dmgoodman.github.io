					<h1 class="regularText" style="text-align:center">Here are some extras and downloads!</h1>
					<br/>
					My most recent programming project is this <a href="../fmc" target="_blank">Insertion Trainer</a> for Fewest Moves practice. This program allows you to practice insertions by giving you a scramble and
					a skeleton. Your goal is to find the optimal insertion to get the most points. If you're an FMC solver, make sure to give it a try!				
					<br/><br/>
					This is a <a href="../redi/sim" target="_blank">Redi Cube simulator</a> and corresponding <a href="../redi/scrambler" target="_blank">full-fledged Redi Cube scrambler</a>!
					The scrambler is random state and was originally made by xyzzy on the Speedsolving forums; I just adapted it to also show a picture of the puzzle for each scramble. It generates five scrambles in a similar
					format to TNoodle, and allows the user to easily print them as well. Unfortunately as of now, the images look more like a 3x3 than a Redi Cube, due to the centers not being split among the four surrounding
					edges. However, the centers are actually transparent, not white, so they are just meant to be ignored for now.					
					<br/><br/>
					Hidden on this site, you'll also find <a href="../breakout" target="_blank">this browser-based game of Atari Breakout</a>. It's my second ever game, and it's got a decent amount of features, such as different colored
					blocks for different levels, a points system, and an extra life for every 10,000 points. I plan to add more in the future to make it follow the laws of physics better, but this is all I've got for now.
					<br/><br/>					
					Another game hidden on the site is <a href="../pong" target="_blank">this browser-based game of Pong</a>. It's the first game I ever programmed, so I decided to keep it simple, but it can still be pretty fun.
					It currently supports both 1 and 2-player games.
					<br/><br/>
					A recent addition to the site is my <a href="../l4e" target="_blank">intuitive L4E trainer</a>! Similarly to other algorithm trainers, this page supplies
					you with a timer and a random intuitive L4E case. The goal is to help people who use L4E for Pyraminx get faster at this step.
					<br/><br/>
					Developed by Goodie and Luke (me and a friend) is a <a href="../sam" target="_blank">Samchillian Tip Tip Tip Cheeepeeeee</a> simulator. The Samchillian
					is a musical instrument that, instead of having each key specific to a note, each key is specific to an increment. Therefore, things like scales can be
					played by pressing the same key multiple times. We did not invent this instrument, although we did spend a couple hours in an afternoon programming this
					version of it. As of now, it only supports the C-major scale, but we plan on adding more scales (as well as more features) in the future. To play a
					recognizable theme from The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time, simply type these notes while on the page:
					<br/>l k j s k j s k j l f d j f d d f j k d j k j s k j s k j l f d j k s d k d s j
					<br/><br/>
					Next is <a href="../memes" target="_blank">a semi-secret page on my website filled with, for lack of a better word, memes</a> (basically just any bad cuber puns I can come up with and Photoshop into an image).
					Enjoy, and make sure to give credit to the site if you use any of them.
					<br/><br/>
					Now for some downloads, first is an Excel spreadsheet that allows you to experimentally find the frequencies of all 21 PLLs. There is
					a version for newer versions of Microsoft Excel, and one that works all the way back to Excel '97. The next
					download is another type of PLL spreadsheet meant to keeping track of your PLL PBs. It also gives you some cool statistics and a useful graph.
					<br/><br/>
					<a href="PLL_Blank.xlsx" download="PLL_Blank.xlsx">PLL Frequency Spreadsheet</a>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="PLL_Blank_'97.xls" download="PLL_Blank_'97.xls">PLL Frequency Spreadsheet '97</a>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="PLLTimesBlank.xlsx" download="PLLTimesBlank.xlsx">PLL Times Spreadsheet</a>
					<br/><br/>
					The last item here is an automatic cube reviewer I made in Python a long time ago. All you need to do is enter a few stats about the cube and the program will return
					a review! You will probably need to download the latest version of Idle from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python website</a> in order
					to run this program.
