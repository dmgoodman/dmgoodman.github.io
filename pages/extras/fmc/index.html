					<br/> \
					<h2>What are insertions?</h2> \
					<p>Insertions are a technique used for solving the Rubik\'s Cube in the fewest moves. The general idea is that the entire cube is solved, \
					except for a few pieces. This partial solution, known as a skeleton, is then searched through to find places where these few remaining \
					pieces can be solved. These pieces are frequently solved using commutators, which are known as insertions for the purposes of this event \
					due to the way they are inserted into the skeleton. Ideally, some of the moves of the insertions will cancel with some of the moves of the \
					skeleton, allowing for the cube to be solved much more efficiently.</p> \
					\
					<h2>What does this program do?</h2> \
					<p>This program was created to allow Fewest Moves solvers to practice their skills with insertions without having to do an entire hour-long \
					solve every time. There are currently ' + amount.toString() + ' insertions of many different types stored in the database, and this number is \
					constantly increasing. It also has a points system to allow the solver to keep track of their progress over time.</p>\
					<h2>How do I use this program?</h2> \
					<p>Click the "Play" button above to try out an insertion! You will be asked for your current data (leave this blank if this is your first \
					time using the site). Next, choose the insertion type you want to practice. If any of them are greyed out, it means you have done all the \
					ones we currently have to offer (but don\'t worry, because we plan to frequently add more!). Then, take as much time as you need to find \
					the best insertion you can, but keep in mind that the faster and more efficient you are, the more points you earn. Try to find the right \
					balance of time spent and moves canceled to gain the most points. Once you submit a successful solution, you will be given your time, and \
					you will get to see the optimal solution. You will also be able to export your new data, with your new points added. Unfortunately, you \
					must currently store all your data locally, but we plan to add more server-side options in the future! \
					\
					<h2>How are points calculated?</h2> \
					<p>Points for each solution are a combination of efficiency and time left over. The exact formula is:</p> \
					<p id="pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points = 15 + {2 * [optimal movecount + (2 * number of insertions) - submitted movecount]} + {0.015 * [time limit - seconds taken]} + optimal solution bonus</p> \
					<p>The number of insertions are determined by the optimal solution given by Insertion Finder, NOT by the solution submitted. The only exception \
					is for 1-cycle 5c or 5e insertions, which count as 1.5 insertions. This was done because these insertions (although they involve 2 algorithms \
					each) can be found in one pass, making them faster than other 2-insertion cases.</p> \
					<p>The optimal solution bonus is achieved if your solution is optimal (or, in rare cases, sub-optimal). It is calculated by multiplying the \
					amount of insertions by 10. \
					<p>Exceptions to the formula:</p> \
					<p>If the submitted movecount is greater than optimal movecount + (2 * number of insertions), this entire part of the formula will be set to 0. \
					It will never be negative, so points will never be lost for bad attempts.</p> \
					<p>If the amount of seconds taken is greater than the time limit, this part of the formula will also be set to 0, meaning no points will ever \
					be lost for going over.</p> \
					\
					<h2>How are time limits decided?</h2> \
					<p>Time limits are decided according to this table:</p> \
					<table> \
						<thead> \
							<td># insertions</td> \
							<td>Time limit</td> \
						</thead> \
						<tr> \
							<td>1</td> \
							<td>5:00</td> \
						</tr> \
						<tr> \
							<td>1.5</td> \
							<td>8:00</td> \
						</tr> \
						<tr> \
							<td>2</td> \
							<td>12:00</td> \
						</tr> \
						<tr> \
							<td>3</td> \
							<td>20:00</td> \
						</tr> \
					</table> \
					<p>Admittedly, these time limits are somewhat arbitrary, but they were created to reflect the amount of time that should be spent on these \
					insertions in a real Fewest Moves solve.</p> \
					<h2>Who made this program?</h2> \
					<p>I, Daniel Goodman, originally made this program over a few months for a school project. However, I do plan to update it regularly now that \
					the initial project is complete.</p> \
					<h2>Something is VERY broken or doesn\'t work!</h2> \
					<p>I\'m not surprised, but I do want to know so I can fix it! Send any bug reports or problems you have using the site to \
					<a href="mailto:dgcubed@gmail.com?Subject=Insertion%20Trainer%20Bug%20Report">dgcubed@gmail.com</a>.</p> \
