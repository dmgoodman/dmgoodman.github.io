						Hey there! My name is Daniel Goodman, but you may know me better in the cubing community as DGCubes. I started my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DGCubes" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> on May 10, 2013 and uploaded consistently through 2022. Starting out, I focused mainly on unboxings and reviews of the latest speedcubes, but over time I started throwing story videos, Q&As, comedy videos, and plenty of other one-off ideas I have into the mix. In early 2022 I started a new non-cubing channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DGtheArtist" target="_blank">DG the Artist</a>, which is now the main place I upload. You can expect mostly music-related content there, but I post lots of fun skits, occasional linguistics videos, and other random content there too. As far as equipment, I edit with Adobe Premiere Elements 2024, and I record with my Google Pixel 5a for video and a Blue Yeti microphone for audio.
						<br/><br/>
						Over the years, I've worked on quite a few other cubing-related projects as well. I co-hosted the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DlsonePodcastOfficial" target="_blank">Dlsone Podcast</a> with my close friends <a href="https://www.youtube.com/TheRubiksCubed" target="_blank">TheRubiksCubed</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/TheProgrammingCuber" target="_blank">TheProgrammingCuber</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DerpyCuber" target="_blank">Derpy Cuber</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/HashtagCuber" target="_blank">Hashtag Cuber</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/JRCuber" target="_blank">JRCuber</a>. I also helped organize and commentate for <a href="https://www.cubingathome.com/" target="_blank">Cubing at Home</a>, an online cubing competition that had thousands of participants. In May 2020 I started doing livestreams where I practiced speedcubing and NES Tetris, doing Q&As with chat, hosting episodes of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Cubing Edition, and tons of other fun stuff! While I only stream occasionally nowadays, I love doing it and would love to make it a regular thing again someday. It'd be great to see you stop by at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dgcubeslive" target="_blank">DGCubesLive</a>.
						<br/><br/>
						On the topic of speedcubing, I've been solving cubes since April 2012 and speedcubing competitively since January 2013. So far I've been to <span id="comps">77</span> competitions and I've completed <span id="solves">3217</span> official solves. Additionally, I was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08AtTIeucUc" target="_blank">2018 US national champion in Pyraminx</a>, and I've been ranked in the top 10 worldwide for Pyraminx average. I also practice and have results in every WCA event for both single and average, which is one of my proudest cubing achievements. You can find all my official results on my <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013GOOD01" target="_blank">WCA profile</a>. I've also speedsolved some unofficial events in the past; my personal favorites are Curvy Copter, Redi Cube, Kibiminx, and Master Pyraminx. I've always been an advocate for more events in the WCA, and these would be some of my top choices.
						<br/><br/>
						As far as non-cubing hobbies go, I love listening to rap music as well as writing and recording my own; you can check it out on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dg-the-artist" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2JAYeInLHFc20FeZ5eFNyY" target="_blank">Spotify</a> (or wherever you listen to music - just search for DG the Artist). I also play a lot of NES Tetris, and although I'm not at a competitive level yet (PB is 977,020 points on a level 18 start), I hope to keep improving and potentially compete in the CTWC someday. As far as education, I graduated with a Computer Science degree and a Linguistics certificate from Princeton University in 2022; I really enjoy programming and learning about linguistics in my free time so those were a great match for me. Since graduation, I've started working full-time as a software development engineer at Twitch, which has been great so far! I also love learning languages; I took classes in Spanish and ASL (American Sign Language) at Princeton, and I've been learning Vietnamese online with a tutor since 2022.

						If you want to reach out, you can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:dgcubed@gmail.com" target="_blank">dgcubed@gmail.com</a> or comment on any of my videos or Twitch streams. I do read most of the comments I get, and I try to reply to as many as possible! Note that the only official DGCubes social media accounts are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DGCubes" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DGCubes/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dgcubeslive" target="_blank">Twitch</a>. I also have the following DG the Artist social media accounts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DGtheArtist" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theartistdg/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091824240086" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/theartistdg" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theartistdg" target="_blank">TikTok</a>. If you find any others, they're not legitimate.
